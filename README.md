**Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys** 

The goal of this project is to explore a dataset and answer questions asked by the client. We work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. 

We will answer the questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- Are long time employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- Are older employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?

Based on our analysis, we can claim that senior employees and/or employees who are older are more likely to resign due to dissatisfaction with the job. 

- 42% of the employees who mentioned dissatisfaction as the reason for resigning are older than 50 years of age
- 38% of the employees who mentioned dissatisfaction as the reason for resigning had 7 or more years of service
